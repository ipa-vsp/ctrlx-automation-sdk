summary: Example app for ctrlX Data Layer vtem.monitor
description: |
  The example project datalayer.realtime shows the realtime access to the ctrlX Data Layer as
  - a data provider - mem owner - creates some memory 'input' and 'output'
  - a data consumer - mem user - can read 'input' and write 'output'
  When the user has written outputs once, the owner will start copying from output to input.
